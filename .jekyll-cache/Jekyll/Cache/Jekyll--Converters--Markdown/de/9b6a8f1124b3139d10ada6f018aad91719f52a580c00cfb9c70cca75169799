I"ƒ<p>Understanding privacy involves knowing the fundamentals of differential privacy and federated learning systems. There seems to be quite a lot of interest in the theory of privacy as well as knowing how to exactly deploy these systems. This first primer in a long series of posts will provide the basics to get started with the theoretical foundations, basic implementations (open-source) and how to deploy it in research and industry. Iâ€™ll host these on GitHub (hosted at <a href="https://github.com/thehimalayanleo/APrimerOnDifferentialPrivacy">A Primer on Differential Privacy</a>) along with a compiled list of relevant resources.</p>
